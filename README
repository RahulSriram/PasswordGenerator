This is a random password generation application that I wrote in java

There are 2 java files, one is the Command Line Interface, whose usage is shown below, and a Graphical Interface which is easy to use

Usage:
	java PasswordGenerator <length> <rules>

Where <length> is the length of the password, and rules are as follows:
a -> include lowercase characters in password
A -> include uppercase characters in password
d -> include numbers in password
x -> include special characters in password

example:
	java PasswordGenerator 15 aAd

Generates a 15 character long password that contains lowercase, uppercase characters and digits in it
