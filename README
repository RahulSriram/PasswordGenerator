This is a random password generation application that I wrote in java

The source consists of a Graphical Interface which is easy to use, and a Command Line Interface, whose usage is shown below,

Usage:
	java PasswordGenerator <length> <rules>

Where <length> is the length of the password, and rules are as follows:
a -> include lowercase characters in password
A -> include uppercase characters in password
d -> include numbers in password
x -> include special characters in password

example:
	java PasswordGenerator 15 aAd

Generates a 15 character long password that contains lowercase, uppercase characters and digits in it
